# IssueTracker
This is an SQL_lite database to track issues or defects that need to be fixed. 
It is for tracking all the data related to project issues from when they are reported through when they are fixed.  

The original intention was for more practice with SQL.  

Limitations found:
There were limitations with creating this in SQL_lite that would not exist in SQL.  As an example: SQL_Lite does not do full joins, but SQL does.
